# Finding 30 Anime Images (JK + Over-the-knee socks)

## Goal Description
The user wants 30 anime-style images featuring "JK" (Schoolgirls) and "Over-the-knee socks". I will source these from a safe image provider (Safebooru) to ensure content safety.

## User Review Required
None.

## Proposed Changes
### Scripts
#### [NEW] [fetch_images.py](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/fetch_images.py)
A Python script to query the Safebooru API for tags `school_uniform`, `thighhighs` (or `kneehighs`), and `rating:general`. It will download 30 unique images to a local directory.

### Output
#### [NEW] [gallery.html](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/images/gallery.html)
An HTML file to display the downloaded images in a grid.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run the python script and check for 30 downloaded files.
- Open `gallery.html` (via user or mental check) to ensure paths are correct.
