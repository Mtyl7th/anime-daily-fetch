# Image Search Walkthrough

I have successfully downloaded initial 30 anime images featuring "JK" (School Uniform) and "Over-the-knee socks" (Thighhighs) and set up a daily agent.

## Results
- **Images**: Images downloaded to `/Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/images`.
- **Gallery**: An HTML gallery has been created to easily view all images.
- **Daily Agent**: A background service (`com.antigravity.dailyanime`) is installed to download one new image every day at 10:00 AM.

## How to View
Open the following file in your browser:
[gallery.html](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/images/gallery.html)

## Daily Agent
The agent is configured to run `daily_fetch.py` using `launchd`.
- **Log File**: `/Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/daily_fetch.log`
- **Error Log**: `/Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/daily_fetch.err`

## Verification
I have verified that:
1.  30 initial images were downloaded.
2.  The daily agent successfully ran once upon installation, adding a 31st image.
3.  The gallery HTML was updated to include the new image.
