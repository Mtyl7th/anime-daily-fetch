# Cloud Deployment (GitHub Actions)

## Goal Description
Migrate the daily image fetcher to the cloud so the user does not need to keep their Mac open. We will use **GitHub Actions** to run the script daily and **GitHub Pages** to host the gallery.

## User Review Required
- User will need to manually create a GitHub repository and push the code.
- User will need to enable "Read and write permissions" for Workflow actions in their GitHub repo settings.

## Proposed Changes
### Code Refactoring
#### [MODIFY] [daily_fetch.py](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/daily_fetch.py)
- Change absolute paths (`/Users/linchuan/...`) to relative paths ([./images](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/fetch_images.py#6-74)) so the script runs on both Mac and GitHub's servers.

### New Configuration
#### [NEW] [.github/workflows/daily_fetch.yml](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/.github/workflows/daily_fetch.yml)
- A YAML configuration for GitHub Actions.
- Schedule: `cron: '0 2 * * *'` (2:00 UTC = 10:00 AM China Standard Time).
- Steps: Checkout code, install python/requests, run script, commit and push changes.

#### [NEW] [requirements.txt](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/requirements.txt)
- Dependencies file (just `requests`).

#### [NEW] [CLOUD_SETUP.md](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/CLOUD_SETUP.md)
- Step-by-step guide for the user to push this code to GitHub and enable Pages.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run refactored [daily_fetch.py](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/daily_fetch.py) locally to ensure relative paths work.
