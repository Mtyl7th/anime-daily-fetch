# Daily Anime Image Agent

## Goal Description
Deploy a background agent (using macOS `launchd`) that runs every day at 10:00 AM. It will download one new anime image (JK + Over-the-knee socks) that is not already in the collection and update the gallery.

## User Review Required
- The agent will run as a user launch agent.
- Does the user want notifications when a new image is added? (I will skip this for now to keep it simple, just silent update).

## Proposed Changes
### Scripts
#### [NEW] [daily_fetch.py](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/daily_fetch.py)
A script that:
1. Checks existing image IDs in the directory.
2. Queries Safebooru for a batch of images (random page or recent).
3. Finds the first image ID that is NOT in the directory.
4. Downloads it.
5. Re-runs the [generate_gallery.py](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/generate_gallery.py) logic (or imports it) to update the HTML.

### Configuration
#### [NEW] [com.antigravity.dailyanime.plist](file:///Users/linchuan/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4838b3fe-93ca-44a3-ba32-d37f4b912c9b/com.antigravity.dailyanime.plist)
A launchd configuration file to schedule `python3 daily_fetch.py` at 10:00 AM daily.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run `daily_fetch.py` manually once to verify it adds exactly one image.
- Load the plist with `launchctl load`.
- Verify `launchctl list` shows the service.
